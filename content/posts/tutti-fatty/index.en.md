The name of this dish is a playful nod to the Italian _tutti frutti_, usually a mix of sweetened dried fruit. Here, we also use fruits—but the savory kind: eggplants and peppers. Instead of sugar, they’re soaked in fat, hence _Tutti Fatty_.

The fat can feel heavy if you’re new to keto, so the vegetables may be drained and the fat reserved for other dishes. 

### Ingredients:

- 1 cup of healthy fat (butter, avocado oil, high-oleic sunflower, olive oil, etc.)
    
- 1 large bell pepper (or 2 smaller), diced
    
- 1 large eggplant (or 2 small, or a mix with Asian eggplants), peeled if non-organic, diced
    
- 2–3 Tbsp red wine
    
- Salt, to taste
    

### Instructions:

1. **Add the fats:** Add the fats to a large wide pan. Let them melt slowly over medium heat if saturated fat is used.
    
2. **Cook the peppers:** Add the diced peppers. Raise the heat to high and sauté, watching carefully so they don’t burn.
    
3. **Prepare and add the eggplants:** Dice the eggplants (peel if non-organic). Add them carefully to the pan—it will be full. Stir gently so they soak up the fat fully. Add more oil if needed.
    
4. **Fry slowly:** Keep the heat high and stir regularly, guided by smell. The eggplants should soften fully and brown just a little, not burn. This takes time.
    
5. **Finish with wine:** Add a splash of red wine, stir until it blends in.
    
6. **Serve warm:**  The side pairs especially well with leaner meats.
