This recipe’s name is a playful nod to the Italian _tutti frutti_, usually a mix of sweetened dried fruit. Here, we also use fruits—but the savory kind: eggplants and peppers. Instead of sugar, they’re soaked in fat, hence _Tutti Fatty_.

The fat can feel heavy if you’re new to keto, so the vegetables may be strained and the fat reused for other dishes. 

### Ingredients (serves 6):

- 1 cup (230 g) butter
    
- 2 Tbsp hard fat (palm oil or coconut oil)
    
- 2 Tbsp neutral liquid fat (avocado oil, high-oleic sunflower, etc.)
    
- 1 large bell pepper (or 2 smaller), diced
    
- 1 large eggplant (or 2 small, or a mix with Asian eggplants), peeled if non-organic, diced
    
- 2–3 Tbsp red wine
    
- Salt, to taste
    

### Instructions:

1. **Melt the fats.** Add butter and palm/coconut oil to a large wide pan. Let them melt slowly over medium heat.
    
2. **Cook the peppers.** Add the diced peppers. Raise the heat to high and sauté, watching carefully so they don’t burn.
    
3. **Prepare and add the eggplants.** Dice the eggplants (peel if non-organic). Add them carefully to the pan—it will be full. Stir gently to coat them in fat.
    
4. **Add more fat.** Eggplant soaks up fat quickly. Pour in the liquid fat so the bottom of the pan isn’t dry.
    
5. **Fry slowly.** Keep the heat high and stir regularly, guided by smell. The eggplants should soften fully and brown just a little, not burn. This takes time.
    
6. **Finish with wine.** Add a splash of red wine, stir until it blends in.
    
7. **Serve warm**.  The side pairs especially well with leaner meats.
