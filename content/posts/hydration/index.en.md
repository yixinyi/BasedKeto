High-fat meals take much longer to digest than carbohydrate-heavy ones—sometimes 5 hours or more, especially if digestion is slow. Digestion itself draws water into the gut, while the extended stomach-emptying time reduces how much water can be absorbed during this period. For this reason, it’s important to plan water intake around meals to avoid discomfort while staying properly hydrated between them. The following protocol offers a simple way to optimize hydration and support digestion on a high-fat ketogenic diet:


1. **Pre-Meal Water**
    
    - Drink **2–3 cups (≈500–700 ml)** of water **10–30 minutes before eating**.
        
    - Ensures hydration before food arrives, supporting enzymes, bile flow, and smooth digestion—especially important since you may not be able to drink again for 3 hours or more.
        
2. **During Meals**
    
    - Sip small amounts of warm or hot water only, or none at all.
        
    - Cold or even room-temperature water can slow fat digestion and trigger cramps.
        
        
3. **Post-Meal Water**
    
    - Wait until the stomach has emptied before drinking larger amounts. High-fat meals may take **3–5+ hours**.
        
    - Once emptied, you can drink freely.




Note: Drinking water with very low electrolytes—such as purified water—is generally fine if the meal is salty enough. Adequate sodium is especially important on keto to help prevent “keto flu.”
