This keto eggplant sauce reimagines the Middle Eastern classic _baba ganoush_ in a gentler, digestion-friendly form. It omits tahini and garlic, using extra oil to achieve a rich, creamy texture without heaviness. Eggplant’s natural fibers emulsify the mixture, binding oil and flavor into a smooth, balanced sauce that’s never greasy. High in fiber and antioxidants, it serves equally well as a dip, side, or topping for meat.

### Ingredients

- 2 medium eggplants  
- 1 cup extra virgin olive oil (or high-oleic sunflower oil)  
- 1–2 tbsp chopped fresh herbs (parsley, cilantro, or dill)  
- 1–2 tbsp fresh lemon juice or apple cider vinegar (to taste)  
- Salt to taste  
- *(Optional)* ½ cup Greek yogurt or cream cheese for extra creaminess  
- *(Optional)* ¼ tsp ground cumin or smoked paprika, if tolerated  

### Instructions

1. **Roast the Eggplants:** Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Prick eggplants with a fork, brush lightly with oil, and roast whole for 50-60 minutes until the skin is wrinkled and the flesh soft.  

2. **Cool and Drain:** Let cool slightly. Cut open and scoop out the flesh. Place in a colander for 10–15 minutes to drain excess moisture.

3. **Blend:** Blend the eggplant with olive oil, lemon juice or vinegar, salt, herbs, and optional spices. If using yogurt or cream cheese, blend or mix it in last for a smoother texture.

4. **Taste and Adjust:** Add more salt, oil, or acidity to balance the flavor as needed.

5. **Serve:** Spoon into a bowl. Top with fresh herbs. Serve with grilled meats, spoon over roasted vegetables, or use as a veggie dip.  

6. **Storage:** Keeps in the fridge for up to 5 days. Flavor improves overnight.
