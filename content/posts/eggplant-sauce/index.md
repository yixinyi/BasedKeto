This keto eggplant sauce is adapted from the Middle Eastern classic *Baba Ganoush*—but made gentler for sensitive digestion. It skips tahini and garlic, adds more oil, and retains that creamy richness. Perfect as a dip, side, or topping for meat.


### Ingredients

- 2 medium eggplants  
- 1 cup extra virgin olive oil (or high-oleic sunflower oil)  
- 1–2 tbsp chopped fresh herbs (parsley, cilantro, or dill)  
- 1–2 tbsp fresh lemon juice or apple cider vinegar (to taste)  
- Salt to taste  
- *(Optional)* ½ cup Greek yogurt or cream cheese for extra creaminess  
- *(Optional)* ¼ tsp ground cumin or smoked paprika, if tolerated  
- **Tip:** Ask your AI assistant for spice/herb pairings to match your taste.


### Instructions

1. **Roast the Eggplants**  
   Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).  
   Prick eggplants with a fork, brush lightly with oil, and roast whole for 30–40 minutes until the skin is wrinkled and the flesh soft.  

2. **Cool and Drain**  
   Let cool slightly. Cut open and scoop out the flesh.  
   Place in a colander for 10–15 minutes to drain excess moisture.

3. **Blend**  
   Blend the eggplant with olive oil, lemon juice or vinegar, salt, herbs, and optional spices.  
   If using yogurt or cream cheese, blend or mix it in last for a smoother texture.

4. **Taste and Adjust**  
   Add more salt, oil, or acidity to balance the flavor as needed.

5. **Serve**  
   Spoon into a bowl. Top with fresh herbs.


### Tips & Notes

- **Storage:** Keeps in the fridge for up to 5 days. Flavor improves overnight.  
- **Serving Ideas:** Serve with grilled meats, spoon over roasted vegetables, or use as a veggie dip.  
- **Why It Works:** Eggplant fibers act as a natural emulsifier, helping the oil and other ingredients bind together. The result is smooth and creamy—not oily. It's also rich in fiber and antioxidants, making this sauce both satiating and gut-friendly.
