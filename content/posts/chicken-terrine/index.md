A silky, herb-infused chicken terrine with a 2:1 fat-to-protein ratio, featuring fresh basil and rosemary to help protect against oxidation. The chicken protein acts as a natural emulsifier, giving the terrine its smooth texture, enhancing protein digestion, and providing healthy calories—making it very gut-friendly. This is a great keto staple, with the macros are all covered.


### Ingredients

- **1.2 lb** lean ground chicken
    
- **1 cup** fat (butter, olive oil, high-oleic sunflower oil, or a mix)

- **1 tbsp** of olive oil
    
- **1 cup** fresh basil leaves, loosely packed
    
- **1 tbsp** unflavored gelatin
    
- **¼ cup** apple cider vinegar
    
- **Salt & freshly ground pepper**, to taste
    
- **5 sprigs** fresh rosemary (or as much as you like, for preventing chicken oxidation)
    
- **1/4 cup** cold water (for blooming gelatin)

### Method

1. **Season the Chicken**  
    In a large bowl, combine ground chicken with salt, pepper, and a 1 tbsp of olive oil. Mix well, then shape into large balls about 3 inches in diameter.
    
2. **Prepare Rosemary Poaching Liquid**  
    In a pot, simmer water with the rosemary sprigs for about 5 minutes to infuse.
    
3. **Poach the Chicken Balls**  
    Gently lower the chicken balls into the rosemary water. Poach at a gentle simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches **160°F (71°C)**. Remove and let cool slightly.
    
4. **Melt the Fat**  
    If using butter, melt **8 oz (1 cup)** over low heat until fully liquid. 
    
5. **Bloom the Gelatin**  
    In a small bowl, sprinkle gelatin over **1/4 cup cold water** and let sit for 1 minute.
    
6. **Blend the Terrine**  
    In a high-speed blender or food processor:
    
    - Add the poached chicken, apple cider vinegar, extra salt and pepper, and **½ cup warm water or rosemary broth**. Blend until partly smooth.
        
    - Pour in the melted fat and continue blending.
        
    - Add the basil leaves and blend again until very smooth.
        
    - Finally, add the bloomed gelatin and blend one last time until fully incorporated.
        
7. **Set and Chill**  
    Transfer the mixture into a loaf pan, terrine mold, or a simple glass container. Smooth the top, cover with a lid or plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, until firm.
    
8. **Serve**  
    Slice or scoop and serve cold — as a complete meal or paired with side vegetables such as grilled peppers.
